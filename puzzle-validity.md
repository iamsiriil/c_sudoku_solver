# Puzzle Validity

#### A **sudoku** puzzle of size $$n$$ if valid if, and only if:

1. $$n$$ is a perfect square, i.e. $$\sqrt{n}$$ is an integer.
2. The grid contains exactly $$n \times n$$ values $$v$$
3. For each value $$v$$, $$1 \leq v \leq n$$.
4. The grid is divisible into sub-grids of size $$\sqrt{n} \times \sqrt{n}$$.
5. Every line must contain all numbers, from $$1$$ to $$n$$, without repetitions.
6. Every column must contain all numbers, from $$1$$ to $$n$$, without repetitions.
7. Every sub-grid must contain all numbers, from $$1$$ to $$n$$, without repetitions.
8. The puzzle must be solvable.&#x20;
9.  There can only be one valid solution to the puzzle, and no more.
